# project_structure_script.py
"""
A utility script to automatically generate the directory structure for the
IDentrix person re-identification project.

This script is for convenience and is typically run only once at the beginning
of the project setup. It creates all the necessary folders and placeholder files.

Running this script is optional; you can also create the directories and
files manually.
